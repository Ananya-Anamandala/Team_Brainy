###Problem Description
Brainy n Bright (www.brainynbright.com) is a center of Science & Technology offering 150+ programs on technology globally for
students of age 6 years and above. We counsel and provide young adults and working professionalsâ€™ skill-based courses to prepare
for 21st century STEM skills.
Students and parents are often confused about course selection, and it is important that they have access to information and the
right tools to guide them, so they can make informed decisions. This project might help to address the need for course
recommendation by developing a system that will assist the counsellor to offer courses to students based on academic interest,
demographic and learning history, previous taken courses, shown interest, or participated relevant seminars etc. Students will be
required to develop an ML model to recommend the right course for the students.

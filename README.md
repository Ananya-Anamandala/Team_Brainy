###Problem Description
Brainy n Bright (www.brainynbright.com) is a center of Science & Technology offering 150+ programs on technology globally for
students of age 6 years and above. We counsel and provide young adults and working professionalsâ€™ skill-based courses to prepare
for 21st century STEM skills.
Students and parents are often confused about course selection, and it is important that they have access to information and the
right tools to guide them, so they can make informed decisions. This project might help to address the need for course
recommendation by developing a system that will assist the counsellor to offer courses to students based on academic interest,
demographic and learning history, previous taken courses, shown interest, or participated relevant seminars etc. Students will be
required to develop an ML model to recommend the right course for the students.
###
SYSTEM:
The system that is being used for the model is a hybrid recommendation system.
HYBRID RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM:
A hybrid recommendation system is a recommendation system that combines two or more recommendation algorithms to produce a single recommendation. Creating a hybrid recommendation system often includes choosing suitable algorithms, integrating the algorithms, and meaningfully combining the outputs. For the AI model, the hybrid system comprises of content based and knowledge based recommendation.
CONTENT-BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM:
Content based recommendation system is used to give suggestions based on the previous user history and on the basis of their likes.
KNOWLEDGE-BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM: A knowledge-based recommendation system is a type of recommendation system that uses explicit knowledge about the items being recommended and the users' preferences to make recommendations. Unlike collaborative filtering, which relies on the behavior of similar users, knowledge-based recommendation systems use domain-specific knowledge and user preferences to make recommendations. In a knowledge-based recommendation system, items are characterized by features or attributes, such as genre, author, or price. The system uses these features to make recommendations. The user's preferences are also represented by a set of features, such as favorite authors or preferred price range, and the system uses this information to make personalized recommendations.
